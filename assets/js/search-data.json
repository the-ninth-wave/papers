The number of saddles of the spherical $p$-spin model | with Antonio Auffinger | . | We explore the structure of random, high-dimensional, non-convex energy landscapes associated to a class of spin glass models. Due to these characteristics, such landscapes pose difficult optimization problems, namely navigation of valleys and peaks towards a desired low altitude( = energy) region, using only the local features of the landscape to guide the navigation. This type of optimization problem is relevant to chemistry and computer science. In the former case, one encounters energy landscapes associated to large molecules. Valleys of such landscapes are numerous, as they correspond to the ways the molecule can fold into a low energy, often functional state. In the latter case, there is active interest in the similarities between spin glass landscapes and loss landscapes of neural networks. There has been some debate about the nature of this similarity, though recent work of Baskerville, Granziol and Keating (arXiv : 2102.06740) suggests possible connections through random matrix theory. In this paper, Tuca and I built a novel large deviation principle for the spectra of pairs of correlated random matrices. These objects represent the curvature of the energy landscape at a pair of critical points, such as two valleys, or a valley and a mountain-pass (a ‘saddle point’). Using this principle, we develop methods towards understanding the structure of the bridges connecting valleys of the landscape. In the ML context, this kind of information can be used to better navigate with gradient descent. | . Value A2 | Value B2 | . Value A2 | Value B2 | .",
