| The number of saddles of the spherical $p$-spin model |

$\quad\quad$ with [Antonio Auffinger](https://sites.math.northwestern.edu/~auffing/)

  We explore the structure of random, high-dimensional, non-convex energy landscapes associated to a class of spin glass models. Due to these characteristics, such landscapes pose difficult optimization problems, namely navigation of valleys and peaks towards a desired low altitude $\equiv$ energy region, using only the local features of the landscape to guide the navigation. 

  This type of optimization problem is relevant to chemistry and computer science. In the former case, one encounters energy landscapes associated to large molecules. Valleys of such landscapes are numerous, as they correspond to the ways the molecule can fold into a low energy, often functional state. In the latter case, there is active interest in the similarities between spin glass landscapes and loss landscapes of neural networks. There has been some debate about the nature of this similarity, though [recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06740) of Baskerville, Granziol and Keating suggests possible connections through random matrix theory. 

  In this paper, Tuca (Auffinger) and I built a novel large deviation principle for the spectra of pairs of correlated random matrices. These objects represent the curvature of the energy landscape at a pair of critical points, such as two valleys, or a valley and a mountain-pass (a _saddle point_). Using this principle, we develop methods towards understanding the structure of the bridges connecting valleys of the landscape, crucial information for studying dynamics.

| Dynamical freezing in a spin glass system with logarithmic correlations |

$\quad\quad$ with [Aser Cortines](http://user.math.uzh.ch/cortines/) and [Oren Louidor](https://ie.technion.ac.il/~olouidor/)

The paper considers low-temperature dynamics of a disordered system. This system is characterized by an energy landscape with many peaks and valleys. The dynamics studied are those of a landscape explorer. The exploration is governed by a temperature-like parameter, which effectively sets the preferred elevation of the explorer of the landscape.

When the temperature is low enough, the system 'freezes'. We study the effect of this glass-like phase transition on the dynamics. Below the freezing point, the preferred elevation set by temperature is far below the lowest valley of the landscape. Consequently, in the correct reference frame, the dynamics appear to teleport between the lowest valleys of the landscape after waiting a random amount of time, on average waiting longer in the deepest valleys. The main contribution of our paper is to make this picture rigorous.

A key input to our argument was a recent series of works by Biskup and Louidor, who gave an extremely precise description of the structure surrounding peaks and valleys of the landscape. To describe the dynamics as the system size grows, we relied on ideas from the literature on [trap models](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Glassy_dynamics), abstractions of the low-temperature dynamics described just above.

| Intrinsic isoperimetry of the giant component of supercritical bond percolation in dimension two |

A smaller component of my PhD thesis. As below, it builds on work of Biskup et al., but changing the geometric constraints on the two-dimensional model instead of going up in dimension. The objects of study are two-dimensional, random 'droplets' confined to a large box. The nature of this confinement results in droplets with a preference to adhere to the box boundary. Many ideas in the Wulff construction, a toolkit central to my thesis, could be used with some modification to obtain results analogous to those in the main component of my thesis, described just below.

| Isoperimetry in supercritical bond percolation in dimensions three and higher |

This paper forms the main component of my PhD thesis. In it, I studied the shapes of large droplets of a random medium. The 'random medium' is a probabilistic model called bond percolation, which has become a fundamental model in probability and physics since its introduction in the 1950s. Defining the model requires only a network and a collection of random bits. Depending on the network, one can observe interesting collective behavior as the network grows in size.

Of physical interest are networks forming lattices in space, an abstraction of crystalline structure. In such networks, percolation can be thought of as modeling a transition from solid to vapor. This model has a temperature parameter, which is tunable, and it determines which phase the material lies in, solid or vapor or exactly at the critical point. Raphaël Cerf had previously studied shapes of large droplets in the vapor phase. In his monographs on the Wulff construction, Cerf assembles a geometric toolkit tailored to studying three-dimensional (as well as higher dimensional) droplets, which I use heavily. Biskup, Louidor, Procaccia and Rosenthal performed a similar study of two-dimensional droplets in the solid phase, and it was my advisor [Marek (Biskup)](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~biskup/) who suggested the three-dimensional version of their problem.

The structure of my paper blends the arguments of Cerf and of Biskup et al. . Cerf's geometric toolkit is essential. However, his conditioning on a rare event leads to a distinct characterization of droplets, versus the solid phase. Here it was necessary to generalize the argument of Biskup et al. to higher dimensions. I was greatly aided by regular meetings with Marek, as well as meetings with Raphaël Cerf for a shorter period of time.

| A bound for orderings of Reidemeister moves |

This paper was my senior thesis at UC Davis, where I was advised by [Alex Coward](https://alexandercoward.com/). The fundamental object in this paper is a knot diagram, a shadow cast by a knot living in three dimensions. The same knot can produce different diagrams by changing the angle of the light source, which is to say the same knot can cast different shadows. Reidemeister moves are a fundamental tool for passing between two diagrams of the same knot without needing a third dimension. These allow knots, which live in three dimensions, to be treated as a group of two-dimensional diagrams, each related to one another by a sequence of moves.

An important statistic of any diagram is the number of crossings. This number may oscillate as Reidemeister moves are successively applied to a diagram. In earlier work, Alex described an algorithm, with input a generic sequence of diagrams, outputting a sequence of diagrams whose crossing numbers follow a prescribed order. The ordered sequence is built "on top of" the unordered one.

My senior thesis quantified Alex's result, bounding the length of the ordered sequence in terms of the length of the input sequence. This involved a careful analysis of each step in Alex's construction.
